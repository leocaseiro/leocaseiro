### Leo Caseiro, Brazilian, father of a boy.

Hi, I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) based in Sydney, and I work in the **Jira Cloud Frontend Performance Team** and our goal is to improve Performance for **Jira Software Cloud**.

My current stack is [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and we host Jira Cloud on AWS.

For the future, my bet goes to the [JAM Stack](https://jamstack.org/), that's why I have both my [Brazilian old blog](https://leocaseiro.com.br/) and my current [online resume](https://leocaseiro.com/) made with [Gatsby.JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

If I'm not coding, or studying, or giving a [talk](https://leocaseiro.com/speaking), I sometimes teach or volunteer as JS mentor for the [Muses Code JS](https://musescodejs.org/).
